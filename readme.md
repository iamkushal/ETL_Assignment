# ETL
This code is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches genomic data from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) API, processes it, and stores it in MySQL and Elasticsearch. Here's a simpler breakdown of how it works:

## 1. What Does the Code Do?
Extracts metadata and FASTA sequences for SARS-CoV-2 samples from South Dakota between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023.

Transforms the data by removing duplicates and caching it to avoid repeated API calls.

Loads the data into MySQL (for structured storage) and Elasticsearch (for search and analysis).

## 2. Key Parts of the Code
- Logging
Logs messages to track what’s happening in the pipeline (e.g., "Fetching data," "Loading to MySQL").

Helps debug issues if something goes wrong.

- Retry Mechanism
If an API call fails (e.g., due to network issues), it retries up to 5 times with a 5-second delay between attempts.

Makes the pipeline more reliable.

- Fetching Metadata
Uses the NCBI esearch API to find sequence IDs matching the query.

For each ID, it fetches detailed metadata using the esummary API.

Caches metadata locally to avoid fetching the same data multiple times.

- Fetching FASTA Sequences
Uses the NCBI efetch API to get FASTA sequences for the IDs.

Caches FASTA sequences locally to save time and avoid repeated API calls.

- Deduplication
Removes duplicate records based on the unique ID (uid).

- Loading to MySQL
Stores metadata and FASTA sequences in a MySQL table called ncbi_records.

Uses REPLACE INTO to update existing records or insert new ones.

- Loading to Elasticsearch
Indexes metadata and FASTA sequences in Elasticsearch for fast searching.

Creates an index called ncbi_records if it doesn’t already exist.

- Main Function
Runs the entire pipeline:

Fetches metadata.

Removes duplicates.

Fetches FASTA sequences.

Loads data into MySQL.

Loads data into Elasticsearch.

*Caching Mechanism*
To avoid redundant API requests, data is cached:

Metadata stored in: cache/metadata/
FASTA sequences stored in: cache/fasta/
Before making a request, the script checks local cache.

## 3. How It All Fits Together
The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files make it easy to run the entire pipeline in a Docker environment.

The cache folder stores temporary data to speed up the pipeline.

The output folder might store final results or logs.

The etl.py script is the core of the pipeline, fetching data, processing it, and loading it into MySQL and Elasticsearch.

## 4. Assumptions
The NCBI API allows multiple requests in a short time.

The dataset isn’t too large (less than 1000 records).

Errors (e.g., network issues) are temporary and can be fixed by retrying.

Caching data locally is okay.

## 5. Possible Improvements
Parallel Processing: Fetch data in parallel to speed things up.

Pagination: Handle larger datasets by fetching data in chunks.

Better Error Handling: Add more specific error messages for different types of failures.

Configuration File: Move settings (e.g., API URLs, database credentials) to a separate file for easier management.

## 6. Thought Process Summary
The code is designed to be simple, reliable, and easy to debug.

It uses caching and retries to handle errors and improve performance.

The pipeline is modular, so each part (fetching, transforming, loading) is separate and easy to update.
